# SAT Standardized Test

## One-on-One Test Prep Tutoring

Our test prep tutors work individually with students to prepare for the SAT and PSAT. We teach students the necessary strategy and concepts needed to do well on the test, as well as important test content. 

Students who schedule one-on-one test prep should bring their previous PSAT or SAT scores. If a lot of time has passed since the student last took the test, or if the student has simply never taken the test before, we can proctor a full-length practice SAT test in our office in order to attain a baseline score. 

To set up one-on-one tutoring test prep tutoring, give us a call: 407-678-4945.

## About the SAT

The SAT is a college-admissions test produced by the College Board. The SAT assesses the student's ability in three areas: reading, writing, and math. The critical reading section includes sentence completions and passage-based questions. The critical reading section is also very vocabulary-intensive, so we recommend students start studying vocabulary as soon as possible. The math section includes questions on arithmetic operations, algebra, geometry, statistics and probability. The writing section includes a short essay and multiple-choice questions on identifying errors and improving grammar and usage.
Most students take the SAT during their junior or senior year. Some students decide to prepare for the test earlier than junior year; however, we like to remind these younger students to not get discouraged if the test seems hard, because it covers material they probably haven't learned yet.
