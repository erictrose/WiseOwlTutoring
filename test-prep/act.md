# ACT Standardized Test

Our test prep tutors work individually with students to prepare for the ACT. While there isn't as much strategy for the ACT as for the SAT, there are a few pointers that will help students to achieve a higher ACT score. We have examined many test forms, which enables us to teach students concepts and content that will likely appear on the test.
 
Students who schedule one-on-one test prep should bring their previous ACT scores. If a lot of time has passed since the student last took the test, or if the student has simply never taken the test before, we can proctor a full-length practice ACT in our office in order to attain a current baseline score.
