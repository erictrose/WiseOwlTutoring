## ACT Class Info

For students who believe they will benefit more from a classroom setting, Bettie offers the 8-Week Class. 

Like one-on-one tutoring, the class covers strategy and material relevant to the four areas of the test: English, Math, Reading and Science.

Instructor: Bettie Wailes, owner of Wise Owl Tutoring

Class size: 10-14 students per class

Fee: $350.00

	•	 $50 nonrefundable deposit to sign up,
	•	 $200 due on first night of class
	•	 Remaining balance ($100) due on or before Class #6
    
Classroom instruction includes:

	•	2-hour class sessions are held once per week for eight weeks. (NOTE: The first and seventh class sessions are longer (3.5 hours) because students take a full-length practice test on those nights.) Also, there is a ninth week class meeting to be used for make-ups and also as a "bonus" class. We encourage students to take advantage of one more opportunity to review material and ask questions.
	•	Students benefit from taking two full-length practice tests--the first is given during Class #1 to obtain a baseline score, and the second is given during Class #7 to measure improvement.         
	•	All sections of the test are covered: English, Math, Reading and Science
	•	Strategy and study hints
	•	Frequently-tested concepts
    
Test preparation materials and resources are included:

	•	The Real ACT Prep Guide , published by ACT test-makers
	•	Concept handouts
