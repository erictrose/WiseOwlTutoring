## SAT Class Info

For students who believe they will benefit more from a classroom setting, Bettie offers the 8-Week Class. 

Like one-on-one tutoring, the class covers strategy and material relevant to the three areas of the test: Critical Reading, Math, and Writing. We do our best to schedule classes so that they end just in time for an SAT date.

Instructor: Bettie Wailes, owner of Wise Owl Tutoring

Class size: 10-14 students per class

Fee: $490.00

	•	$50 nonrefundable deposit to sign up
	•	$200 due on first night of class
	•	Remaining balance ($240) due on or before Class #6
    
Classroom instruction includes:

	•	3-hour* weekly class sessions are held once per week for eight weeks. Even though the class is designed as an eight-week class, there is a ninth week to be used for make-ups in case anyone misses a class. This added class can also be used as a "bonus" class. We encourage students to take advantage of this final opportunity to review material and ask questions.
    ◦	*The first and seventh class sessions are longer (four hours) due to full-length practice test.
	•	Students benefit from taking two full-length practice tests--the first is given during Class #1 to obtain a baseline score, and the second is given during Class #7 to measure improvement.        
	•	Time is spent covering all sections of the test: Critical Reading, Math, and Writing
	•	Strategy and study hints
	•	Frequently-tested concepts in math and grammar.
	•	Vocabulary
