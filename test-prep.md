# Test Prep Tutors in Winter Park, FL

There is no magic pill that will give you higher scores.

1. Know the format of the test so you know what to expect.
2. Know the strategies and rules of the test.
3. Know the material.

Wise Owl Tutoring helps students improve their scores on standardized tests. Rarely does a student need scores from both tests. We recommend that students establish a baseline score on both tests to determine which test is better for the student. If the student has taken the PSAT, those scores are a sufficient indicator of SAT performance. We will gladly show you how to take each one of these tests yourself, or we can proctor either one for you.

For the SAT/PSAT and ACT, we offer both one-on-one test prep tutoring and also group classes. Some students do better in a one-to-one setting, while others prefer a small group class. The class fee includes a study book, a vocabulary book, and a grammar book. These items are not included in the cost of one-to-one tutoring. 

For all other tests, we offer individual tutoring.group classes for SAT/PSAT and ACT.
