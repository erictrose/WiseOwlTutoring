# About Wise Owl Tutoring

## Mission Statement

Our mission at Wise Owl Tutoring sets us apart from the competition: Â To provide high quality, individualized instruction at an affordable fees.

## Our Approach to Tutoring

Wise Owl welcomes students of all ages and learning levels, from elementary school through college, and on into adult education. Students come to Wise Owl to improve comprehension of coursework, to prepare for tests, and to develop effective study habits.

We use an individual approach with each student, and when possible, keep the student with the same tutor. All subject tutoring is one-to-one. For the SAT, we offer both individual tutoring and classes.

## No Contracts or Minimum Hours

For most of our students, 1-2 hours per week is sufficient. Occasionally, a student requests more hours to make up lost time or get back on track quickly. We leave it to the student and parent to determine how often to schedule sessions.

## Quality Tutoring at Affordable Rates

Not only do we recommend scheduling the fewest hours necessary, but keep our rates as low as possible. We realize that tutoring is one more item in budgets that are often already strained, and we try to give the most help for the least cost.

## No Diagnostic Testing

Unlike many tutoring centers, Wise Owl Tutoring does not do diagnostic testing. We don't believe that one-size-fits-all tests have enough benefit to warrant the time, expense and stress involved.

We start working with student on their current assignment because our goal is to increase the student's understanding right away. If a student has gaps in his or her background, we work on those areas as we go. The tutor will observe how the student learns best and at what pace.

## Comfortable & Relaxing Environment

We strive to make Wise Owl a place where students can ask questions freely and build confidence. We provide complimentary snacks and beverages to our students and their parents. We have free wi-fi in our office. Since more than half of our new business comes to us from a word-of-mouth referral, we are convinced that our approach works. Check out our testimonials page!

## History of Wise Owl Tutoring

Wise Owl Tutoring, LLC is owned and operated by Bettie Wailes. Bettie, a retired software engineer, opened Wise Owl after rediscovering her love for teaching coupled with the desire to feel more satisfied at the end of the day. Her primary objective is not to make money, but rather to offer a needed service at a nominal fee. Of course, this is a business, and we need to buy groceries like everyone else. That said, this is not a greed-driven business. We are here because we like the students and because we enjoy teaching.
