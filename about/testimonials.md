## Reviews of Wise Owl Tutoring in Winter Park, FL

Student success and customer satisfaction is why more than 65% of our new business comes from a word-of-mouth referral.

### Algebra 2 & IB Biology
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate the service you provide. My daughter was VERY skeptical about attending tutoring, feeling that it would be a waste of her time. After her first hour with Miglena, she was excited and energized for her next hour with Kathryn. On the way home she could not stop talking about how she now understood radicals. She is looking forward to next week.
-Cathy F.

### Various Subject Areas
Thanks for your help once again. I always hear from my kids each and every time how great you are. I have also heard from all the kids and their parents I have recommended the same kind of sentiment. You have a real gift for relating to kids!
-Kim K.

### Pre-Algebra
Ashley's pre-algebra grade was one point away from failing two weeks into the 9-weeks term. She ended with a 'C' for the 9-weeks. She was so excited. Thanks for your help.
-Mrs. F

### SAT
Ed's SAT score improved 110 points just from using the test strategy you showed him.
-Mrs. F

### SAT
My son's SAT score for just math and reading went up by 300 points. Thanks to your help, he more than qualifies for Bright Futures.
-Mrs. N

### ACT
Alex's ACT composite score improved from 19 to 27! We're so proud of him and we know that it was a combination of study, focus, and help from Bettie.
-Mrs. M

### FTCE
This was a first! During the test, the solutions appeared like magic. Thank you for your departing words which gave me the confidence I needed, which was to remember that I could do it. Those words got me through the more difficult questions, when I would then recall how to breathe, and keep my head up.
-Sandra

### Algebra 1
My daughter's algebra grade has improved from failing to a C.
-Mrs. Hunt

### FTCE
Would you? Could you? You would. You did. And Grateful-I-am. (with apologies to Dr. Seuss)
Please excuse the Suessian humor. I wanted to thank you for your help. I passed the exam this afternoon. If it was not for your tutoring, patience and support, I would never have passed the exam. Thanks for saving my job. I really appreciate it. Maybe I can actually have a chance to try just teaching for a change. Thanks.
-Keith
