### Bettie Wailes, Owner & Test Prep Expert

Bettie taught math for a few years in the 1970s before moving to software development in the simulation and training industry. After nearly twenty-five years in that field, she returned to teaching as a private tutor. She started Wise Owl Tutoring in 2002. Wise Owl has enjoyed steady growth since then, expanding several times and adding tutors and office staff who are motivated by the desire to help students realize and achieve their potential.

As a result of her passion for SAT prep, Bettie has published SAT Words--Priorized, an SAT vocabulary study guide, and SAT Grammar--Prioritized, a grammar workbook. She is currently working on SAT Math--Prioritized. These books provide the most important words and/or concepts in priority order.

Aside from her test prep publications, Bettie has also written a memoir,  Running in the Back of the Pack, also recently published. She has had stories published in three  Chicken Soup for the Soul  books, including Runners,  Grieving and Recovery, and Grandmothers. 

Bettie is also a dedicated marathon runner. She's slow, but determined. To date, she's completed over 250 marathons, including at least one in all 50 states. Bettie is currently working toward 300 marathons, which will earn her admission to the Mega Marathoning List. She also hopes to complete at least 100 in 2014, which will earn membership in the Legends 100 Club. 


Most of our tutors are either upper level or graduate level college students, or recent graduates. They have recent exposure to all the subject material and they empathize with the rigorous schedules and demands of our students.
