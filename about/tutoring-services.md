One-on-One Tutoring, Group Classes and Proctored Tests

Wise Owl Tutoring offers supplemental instruction and test preparation for students in middle school, high school and college.

Our tutors have a working knowledge and an excellent recall in specialized subject areas; they are familiar with local curricula and can explain difficult concepts to students of varying ages and background.

## One-on-One Tutoring

### Subject Tutoring, $40 per hour

Subject tutoring refers to subject-specific coursework that students need help with (e.g. Algebra 1, Honors Geometry, AP Chemistry, Spanish, etc.)

We start with the student's current assignment. For most students, we recommend one hour per week on a recurring basis, two hours if the student is working on more than one subject or has fallen far behind. However, some students prefer to schedule appointments as-needed. Though we can make recommendations, we let the student and parent determine their tutoring needs.

### Test Prep Tutoring, $45 per hour

Test prep tutoring refers to any tutoring done in preparation for SAT, PSAT or ACT college admissions tests. We are well known in the community for our success with helping students improve their scores on these tests.

### Tutoring with Bettie Wailes, $50 per hour

The owner of Wise Owl Tutoring, Bettie Wailes, primarily teaches SAT, PSAT and ACT prep. Occasionally, Bettie works with students on other subjects areas and tests.

Because much of Bettie's time is dedicated to developing helpful test prep resources, her availability to tutor is very limited. Online scheduling is not available for Bettie. To schedule with Bettie, please call our office, 407-678-4945.

## Group Classes div

### 8-Week SAT Prep Class, $490 per student

As an alternative to one-on-one SAT test prep, Wise Owl also offers an 8-week SAT prep course, taught by the owner, Bettie Wailes. Classes provide an opportunity for students to benefit from the exchange of information between classmates. Some students tell us they benefit from a certain amount of peer pressure in the class setting.

We recommend the SAT class especially for students who have taken the PSAT but have yet to take an official SAT. To read more about the 8-week SAT prep classes, please click here, or visit our page on Schedulicity to view upcoming classes.

### 8-Week ACT Prep Class, $350 per student

As an alternative to one-on-one ACT test prep, Wise Owl also offers an 8-week ACT prep course, taught by the owner, Bettie Wailes. Classes provide an opportunity for students to benefit from the exchange of information between classmates.

We recommend the ACT class especially for students who have taken the PLAN but have yet to take an official ACT. To read more about the 8-week ACT prep classes, please click here, or visit our page on Schedulicity to view upcoming classes.

### SAT Crash Course, $60 per student

This one-day, three-hour class is usually held on a Saturday or Sunday, and is equally valuable for two types of students: those who have already had some test prep but want a last-minute reminder of the main concepts and strategies of the test, and those who have not had any test prep but want a "crash course." These classes are usually scheduled approximately 1-2 weeks before official SAT testing dates. 

### ACT Crash Course, $60 per student

This one-day, three-hour class is usually held on a Saturday or Sunday, and is equally valuable for two types of students: those who have already had some test prep but want a last-minute reminder of the main concepts and strategies of the test, and those who have not had any test prep but want a "crash course." These classes are usually scheduled approximately 1-2 weeks before official ACT testing dates. 

### Study Skills Class, $60 per student

"Don't just study more--study effectively!"  The Study Skills Class introduces and promotes the use of study skills and habits that students may have never learned about in school. Students who learn to effectively implement the skills and habits introduced in this class are better equipped to achieve success in their classes, extracurriculars, jobs, and virtually every aspect of life.

The Study Skills Class, taught by Katie Williams, is recommended for students in middle school through the college level. The class covers note-taking, organization, time management, managing test anxiety, and more.

### AP Human Geography Review Class, $150 per student

Prepare for the AP Human Geography exam in Wise Owl's five-session review class, taught by Katie Williams. This five-session class is held anually, usually starting on a Saturday or Sunday in late March/early April

## Full-length Proctored Practice Tests div

For students who have not taken either the SAT or ACT officially, we recommend taking a mock test to establish a baseline score. Also, it is useful for students to get a baseline score on both tests to determine which test the student favors. For the majority of students, it is sufficient to prepare for and take only one of these tests.

### Mock SAT, $30 per student

Please allow 3.5 hours for testing. Includes proctoring in our office, scoring, and test copy.

### Mock ACT, $30 per student

Please allow 3 hours for testing. Includes proctoring in our office, scoring, and test copy.

### Mock PSAT, $25 per student

Please allow 2.5 hours for testing. Includes proctoring in our office, scoring, and test copy.
